### *Tags:* #100daysofcode Challenge

## My Story:
So, I am trying the break into the industry of data science and have been struggling for over a year on the foundations and concepts. And let me tell you it is overwhelming for a person with no background of coding to venutre into this industry filled with expert coders and analysts. Oh!! I have tinkered with basic analysis during my post graduation and for the initial four years of my career when working with a Research Organization. But this...This is an entire different ball game altogether!

## My Inspiration:
I am not sure whether this personal account of my experience or late night rant is going to be useful to anyone out there. But, assuming someone may stumble upon my thought process, I think I need to throw some light on my inspiration to start off with this challenge. 

On April 25, 2020- the world is fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, I am sitting at home under a strict lockdown regime and fighting with constant learning gaps and fear of not achieving my goal of becoming a full stack/atleast semi-good data scientist. Earlier to this documentation on my personal musings, on a day that I was feeling like a complete failure, i stumbled upon the podcast "The Artists of Data Science" hosted by Harpreet Sahota. A brief on the podcast- It basically shares the journey and struggles of people who have created their own niche in the field. 

Listening up on one such podcast by **Angela Baltes**, I found the inspiration to rise above the dumps of feeling like a failure and venture into the core world of applying my learnings from past one year through the **#100daysofcode challenge**. 

I hope that this challenge gives me a jumpstart into my journey towards achieving my goal!
