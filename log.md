# 100 Days of Code- Log
## *data exploration, machine learning, spatial analytics, deep learning*
**(a) Data:** Kaggle Challenge: ROCHE DATA SCIENCE COALITION- Uncover COVID-19
**(b) Coding Plan:** 
(1) Data Wrangling:
Tidying up the dataset with
- Missing Values Treatment
- Treatment of wrong entries
- Changing data types

(2) Data Exploration:
Exploring the data provided under Roche Data Science Coalition- Uncover COVID-19.
The plan is to explore the data using EDA methods and understand the data. 
Coding tasks to be performed:
- Univariate Analysis
- Bivariate Analysis
- Outlier Treatment
- Variable Transformation
- New Variable Creation

## Day 0- 26 April, 2020
**(a) Today's Progress:**
Started with taking a look into the dataset. Prepared a data cleaning pipeline.

**(b) Thoughts/Insights:**
Preliminary look into the data indicates few tidying up of values and dropping of unwanted features.
